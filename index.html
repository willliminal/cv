    <p> <em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.liminalwellbeing.com.au/">Liminal Wellbeing</a></strong>.</em> </p>
    <p>Will Hams was born in Sale on the 14th of July 1994. Growing up as a keen sportsmna, will went on to play in the AFL for the Essendon Football Club after getting drafter in 2012. Following a 4 year stint in the AFL, Will went on to a serious
      of
      jobs before finding his feet at Student Travel Company. Due to the shortcomings of COVID-19 Will found himself a gap in the market supporting shifts in education where the importance of wellbeing was missed. This started the journey of Liminal,
